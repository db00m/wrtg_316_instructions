### 4) Cleanup Document
With the document captured, the app will now prompt you to adjust the cropped image.  You can do this by dragging the dots and boxes along the capture box until it fits your document.  If no cleanup is needed, click the "Continue Scan" button and repeat steps 3 through 5 until entire document is scanned.
