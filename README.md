> [!TIP]
> For the best quality scans, ensure there is high contrast between the document and the background.  For example, the document in the image above is placed on a black desk, ensuring maximum contrast.

### 4) Cleanup Document
With the document captured, the app will now prompt you to adjust the cropped image.  You can do this by dragging the dots and boxes along the capture box until it fits your document.  If no cleanup is needed, click the "Continue Scan" button and repeat steps 3 through 5 until entire document is scanned.
